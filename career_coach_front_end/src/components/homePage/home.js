                Our founder, Carter Naegle, struggled when trying to decide what he wanted to do in tech. He really enjoyed sales but he also enjoyed the technical work of Software Engineering.
                He figured that he couldn't be alone in this struggle. He decided to create a tool to help highschool and college students decide what jobs to pursue in tech.
